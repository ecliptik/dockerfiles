Repo of Dockerfiles

Dockerfiles for `stretch`, `golang` and other official [docker-library](https://github.com/docker-library) images are using [Multiarch](https://github.com/multiarch/debian-debootstrap) as their base and built to support cross-building armhf and arm64 on x86_64 using QEMU.

See [http://www.ecliptik.com/Cross-Building-and-Running-Multi-Arch-Docker-Images/](http://www.ecliptik.com/Cross-Building-and-Running-Multi-Arch-Docker-Images/) for more details on cross-building using Multiarch.
